# Make a GET request to an API endpoint
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/endpoint

# Make a POST request with JSON data
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://api.example.com/endpoint

# Make a PUT request with custom headers
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://api.example.com/endpoint

# Make a DELETE request

By default the response headers are hidden in the output of curl. To show them, use the i option:

Using the I option, you can get only the headers, and not the response body:

The -d flag allows you to pass data in your request

-X or --request: Specifies the HTTP request method. Example: -X GET or --request POST

-H or --header: Adds a custom header to the request. Example: -H "Content-Type: application/json"

-d or --data: Sends data in the request body. Example: -d '{"key": "value"}'

-i or --include: Shows the response headers in the output. Example: -i

-I or --head: Retrieves only the response headers, not the body. Example: -I

-u or --user: Specifies the username and password for authentication. Example: -u username:password

-L or --location: Follows redirects. Example: -L

-o or --output: Writes the response body to a file. Example: -o response.txt

-s or --silent: Suppresses the progress meter and error messages. Example: -s

-v or --verbose: Provides detailed information about the request and response. Example: -v

These are just a few examples of the flags you can use with curl. You can combine multiple flags to customize your requests according to your needs.
